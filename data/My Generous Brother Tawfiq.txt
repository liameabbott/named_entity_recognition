 Full Translation of 1 In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful My Generous Brother Tawfiq (may Allah bless him) Peace be upon you, with Allah's mercy and blessings Today is Friday; I met with the brother from Iran after evening prayers. He stated that sending an individual is very difficult. Also, the Iranians are very interested in working with someone from the chief's side, not just in the subject of the sick people. The Iranians' first priority is the situation in Iraq. Thus, they believe the brothers there, specifically al-Azraq and his group have a hand in the attack on the Shi'a holy sites. Therefore, they want to meet with a delegate from the chief's side to discuss this matter openly; there is also the potential for cooperation. Thus, according to the mediating brother's assessment, the Iranians have a desire to provide support and assistance, if you . The Iranians would also like to receive at least a letter signed by the chief, assuring them that the Shi'a holy sites will not be targeted by the brothers. Furthermore, the holy sites should not be included as targets to attack. The letter should also say that what had happened was a result of planning over there, and the chief and his associates are not pleased and had not agreed to targeting those sites. This was the mediator's statement, and according to my evaluation, the Iranians are not able to directly do anything in Iraq through their followers. They would like to cooperate, but not before receiving some clarifications and insurance. Also, they want to meet with a delegate to discussion many comprehensively detailed topics.
