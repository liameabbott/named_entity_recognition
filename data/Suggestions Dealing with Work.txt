 In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful Praise God and peace and prayers upon His messenger and his family and companions and whoever is guided by Him. To our dear father, may God protect him and keep him in good health, and to keep you well in his grace. We ask God to help us stay on this path until we meet him, amen. Our revered shaykh, I have a few suggestions dealing with work, and I have a personal request. As for the suggestions, here they are: As for the past three years, what have been the results and the failures? As for field results, they cannot be noted except for a few simple operations that were very modest, most of which involved PM rockets from afar. There were other ambush operations but not to the desired levels given the demand. Three operations were performed in the past three years. The slowness in the work is a result of a number of factors, one of which is the strong fear of the Afghans, and the transformation of 90% of them as a result of aerial bombardment, and the shining nature of the dollar. Second: The intense Pakistani pressure on us in the theater of operations resulted in fear among those who helped us and their retreat from assisting us. This has resulted in the decline in the number of operations this summer.
