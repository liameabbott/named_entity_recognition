 In the Name of Allah the most merciful, the most compassionate Praise God, the Lord of the worlds and prayers and peace on our Prophet, Muhammad. To the dear brother, Abu Khalid, May God keep him: 1- This letter is about the cooperation between us and to remove anything that could have disturbed this relationship. It is worth mentioning that since the beginning of our relationship on this path during these years, I found out yesterday that you love Jihad and jihadists and I have in my heart good feelings about you. 2- Brother ‚Amir told me that you misunderstood some of the words I said in recent meetings. You misunderstood them and that was not my intention at all and I will show you at the first opportunity after my health gets better, God willing. If there are any other words that brother ‚Amir forgot to mention, I want to make sure that you say them and if there is any mistake, I will apologize and if they are misunderstood, I will explain my intention. 3- Any suggestion that you have to reduce the pressure on you, I am ready to respond to it to the greatest extent possible, even if it were before the agreed upon period, and there is absolutely no objection on my part; hopefully we will meet as soon as possible so we will be able to organize all our affairs for the coming stage, and I ask that God bring you well-being, rest and goodness. Your brother Abu ‚Abdallah Wednesday 20 January 2011
