 –the letter to Waziristan, but it disappeared and we do not know what the reason was. Also, a testimony was requested from the brothers in Jalalabad, and this request was not complied with and they killed those brothers, and they were four with Abu Amamah, God have mercy on him. I did not mention this to justify what has happened, but we are in an Intelligence battle and humans are humans and no one is infallible. This matter happened to someone better than us, it happened to Khalid and to Usamah, May God be satisfied with them, and to his companion in the battle Uhud, when al-Yaman was killed. God said in His Book: A believer will not kill another believer except if in error, and he said, you are not blamed for mistakes you committed but for what your hearts intended. And in the Prophet's Hadith: God has allowed mistakes and forgetting for this nation. And in the story of Hatib, when a mistake was done but was irreligious, God said; O you who believe, do not betray God and the Prophet, and your faith. O you who believe, do not take a ruler as my enemy and yours. He did not mention that this person was hit by insanity and began to spy for the non-believers and spread the secret of the Prophet. He did not order his exile, but said, He (Allah) is the creator of the creatures, and he is knowledgeable of is in their hearts (O people who believe). And in the story about the Three who succeeded God's Messenger, and they are the best people. Two of them had seen Badr and one was a witness to the al-‚Aqabah pledge of allegiance. God be satisfied with them, he ordered their exile for fifty two days, the period of the battle of Tabuk, because it was in intention and laziness. At the end of their story God said: O who you believe, fear Allah and be truthful, and this happened to the jihadist group in Sudan, and the Islamic Libya group in Kabul.
