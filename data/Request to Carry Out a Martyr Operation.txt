 Our honored shaykh, God knows that I love you, and saying so, even if it did not appear in the Sunnah, I would not have dared to declare my love. I call to God to be faithful to his generous face and glorious nature. Our honored shaykh, when we were the guests of Ghulam Badshah in Kabul, during the night of Khowst's bombardment, I sent you a letter in which I expressed my willingness to carry out a martyr operation anywhere, and in any form, and you agreed. I revisited the issue with you in 2000 1421 HA, and your honor asked me about my passport and told me to be ready, and God willing it will be good. I suspect that the delay is due to the nationality or language, or looks, or age. These issues only reflect outside appearances. Thanks be to God, now there are martyr operations in Iraq taking place without any special features. I ask you in God's name to allow me to carry it out in the fastest time possible so as not to miss the opportunity and the change of conditions. I am suspended here, and the brothers have stopped the issue until a letter comes from you re-agreeing to allow me to carry it out. I have already told them that the shaykh had agreed since 1998, but they asked for a written acceptance from your honor. I beseech you to come through.
