 (2) Third: Up until now, the suitable opportunity has not come to the leading student commanders to begin the jihad against the Americans. The only outlet that opened for us this year was to work in Afghanistan, far from the Pakistani pressure. of the brothers entered Zabil and after their entry, the commanders told them that our work is only on hypocrites and not on the Americans. We are afraid to work in this dreadful way of settling accounts between them. There are some simple operations here; maybe you have heard about them on the news. As for the negative results are the martyrdom of around 22 Arab brothers, most notably Abu-Ayman, and from Pakistan the martyr Hamzah al-Zubayr. The worst is that around 600 brothers, even more than that, are imprisoned, most notably Khalid al-Shaykh, may God set him and his brothers free at our hands, God willing, amen. This debt is on our necks as long as we are alive. The series continues and we pray that God keeps you safe, first for us, second for the Islamic nation, and the rest of the brothers. When God learns of our situation and our lack of ability, may He open for the Islamic nation the door of the jihad in Iraq. Praise God there is one word, one banner, and one clear goal. The man there is known.
