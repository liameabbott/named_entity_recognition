 In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate: To the dear mother, may God protect her I hope this message finds you well. My dear maternal aunt God knows that I am well. All that I lack is seeing you and the joys of my heart Usamah, and Suham, and God willing that will be soon. Praise God you wrote about how my loved ones are doing. You did not write about you and your situation, dear aunt. You are dear to my heart. You are the mother of dear Khadijah, may God have mercy on her. Truly, I do not know how to express and write to you, for the nearly two years you have cared for my loved ones and your grandchildren, and their mother Maryam, God bless her. By God I will not forget your standing by me. May God bring us together for the good. Do not forget us in prayer with patience and testimony and God will accept righteous works from you and us. God bless you. Your son, Abu--((Halabi))
