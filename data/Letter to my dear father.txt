 To my dear father, may Allah protect you and bless you May Allah's peace, mercy and blessings be upon you I write this message and pray to Allah that you are not angry at me; and I pray to Allah that you are in good health, good well-being and have certitude in Allah's grant of His victory. My dear Shaykh and Emir, I found out from Khalid's message that you did not receive one of the messages, Allah is our helper. I wrote in it my travel arrangements, and I would like to tell you that I prefer that Khadijah and the kids move first, then I will move the next day after them. The reason is that there are no problems on the roads for women and children. Khadijah went twice for treatments, and thanks to Allah they do not search women. I prepared myself and the explosives-belt to take with me on the trip. I prefer that the wife be with you and I will be next after them. However, your message reached al-Qari' that there is a risk on the issue; so I (should) stay. Consequently, al-Qari' wrote a message to me about the travel time and wrote that it is preferable to stay, this is what you chose. So, I assumed this was your answer after you read my message that did not reach you (sic). I am here with al-Qari' who found a trustworthy brother who will go to our friend. He will move on the beginning of Sha'ban, may Allah grant us success. Do not forget us in your prayers. May Allah protect you and bless you. Your delinquent son â€šAbd-al-Latif May Allah's peace, mercy and blessings be upon you Rajab 24
