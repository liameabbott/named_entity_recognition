 In the name of God, The Most Merciful, The Most Compassionate. My dear brother Mawlawi 'Abd-al-'Aziz, may God protect you, Peace and blessings be upon you. I hope that you and the respectable brothers are in good health, and I pray to God to reunite us soon in what pleases Him. 1- We received a letter from you dated 9/17 with a compact disk that contained the accounts. 2- Regarding the honey, we have arranged with Tawfiq to follow up on the issue using the thing we entrusted him with. I hope you follow up on the matter. 3- I would also like you to inform our brother Abu Hafs that we wish he would come to us, if it is possible. 4- With regards to al-Azdi, find what he asked for attached with this letter. God is the one who grants success. 5- With regards to al-Khayr's inquiries, we will answer them when meeting him, God willing. He will be located close to us, God willing. 6- Please insist to the brothers with al-Khayr, to immediately refrain from using the internet from their homes. Please inform them expediently and stress its extreme importance. In conclusion, please give my regards to everybody with you, and let them know that they are in our prayers. May God Almighty accept your fasting, staying up late for the prayers, and your good deeds. Please remember us in your prayers during these blessed days. Peace be upon you. Tuesday 27 Ramadan 1423 which corresponds to 3 December 2002.
