 In the name of God, The Most Merciful, The Most Compassionate. God Almighty says, “O ye who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news, ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done.” (Surat al-Hujurat, Verse 6) “Disclaimer” The noble Arab tribe of al-‚Ubayd in Diyala (Ba'aquba) refutes what was broadcast on some satellite televisions that the ‚Ubayd tribe, along with the Bani Tamim, are chasing the resistance and the mujahidin. On behalf of the members of our brave Arab tribe that has defended Iraq from the dawn of history up to this day, we will continue to defend it until our great Iraq is liberated from the occupation of the infidel crusaders. We pledge our full allegiance to the blessed Emir of the Islamic State, ((Abu ‚Umar)) al-Baghdadi, and we vow to support the Mujahidin and the valiant Iraqi resistance and all its factions, as God is my witness. There is no help except from God (Surat al-Imran. Verse 126). We warn the person who spoke on behalf of our noble Arab tribe, and he will be harshly punished by the sons of the tribe, and God is the greatest. On their behalves, Shaykh ‚Abd-al-Wahhab al-((Mandil)), the head Shaykh and al-‚Ubayd tribes in Diyala (Signed and dated 4/28) (TN: year not given) Shaykh Jasim Muhammad al-Faraj al-((‚Ubaydi)) (Signed and dated 4/28) Shaykh ‚Aziz al-((Faraj)) [Signed and dated 4/28)
