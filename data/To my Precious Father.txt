 of 1 To my Precious Father Peace is upon you with God's mercy and blessings. Thanks to God, prayers and greetings on God's Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his kindred, all his followers and those whom he allies with. How are you father? I ask God that you are in the best of conditions. To start: I do not forget your favor in raising us, and deepening the concept of Jihad in our hearts, and on spending on us, and in helping us get married, and a lot more of other things. You have the favor after God in our commitment and guidance to the right path; the road to dignity and gaining the heavens. What a father and how wonderful you are. My precious father: I entrust you well for my wife and children, and that you will always ask about them and follow up on their whereabouts and help them in their marriages and needs. They are from me and I am from you, and they are your sons, too. My precious father: I have enlisted myself an immigrant and mujahid for the sake of God. If I am to be killed, pray for me a lot and give continuous charities in my name, as I will be in great need for support to reach the permanent home. There is another matter: When I got married, Abu Burhan Al-Suri covered the marriage costs and what was after. If these were not from your funds, kindly pay them back, so I will not be trapped in my grave. Finally: I ask God, if I am killed before you, that God will accept my pledge for you, my mother, my sons, daughters, my wife, brothers, sisters, your wives, and all our family. I ask God almighty to give you victory over his enemies, and to establish the Islamic state at the hands of the Mujahideen, sooner or later. I would like you to forgive me, if I have done what you did not like, and convey my greetings to all our family and in particular my mother; that I “would remember in my prayers/strengthen yourselves”. Your son, Sa'ad Bin Usama August 15 2008
